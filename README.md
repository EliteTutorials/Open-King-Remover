 # Open-King-Remover
Android application to remove kingroot, unlicensed for easy modifications.
This application was made to remove kingroot files from Android devices.
I made this because i was sick of having to buy a decent kingroot remover 
on the store.




# Usage   
First of all, You'll need an alternative Super user manager to control su 
and remove or replace it ! I highly recommend SuperSU by @ChainfireXDA.
• Try the compile d version first and see if it works ok    

Compile,  
• Extract the zip file into a new folder and call it whatever you want.
• Open the project in Android Studio and then  rebuild it.
• Edit the file called helper.sh in Assets folder and customise it to your needs.
The assets folder contains the su and busybox from my current system and must
be replaced by your target system's su and busybox files as these files are 
for placement demonstration's  only, and are licensed by @ChainfireXDA for SU
And BusyBox v1.24.2-Stericson (2016-04-23 13:23:09 EDT) multi-call binary.
BusyBox is copyrighted by many authors between 1998-2017
Licensed under GPLv2. See source distribution for detailed
copyright notices. 

Do whatever you want to it ( with the exception of SU, Busybox and Support libraries 'AppCompat') 
Other than su  busybox, this app is unlicensed and can be modified or distributed in any way shape or form !   
  
  I take no responsibility for any damages that you could cause to your system by using this app !   
  By using this project in any way you are agreeing that you will not hold me ( the creator of this app ) or
  Github liable  and/or responsible for any illegal use, damage caused by the usage of this application in 
  any way shape or form.
